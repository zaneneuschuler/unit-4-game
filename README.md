# unit-4-game
A simple guessing game made in JavaScript and html using bootstrap's CSS as a base. 

## How to play?
Just press the gems, each of which is given a random number on game start, in order to try to add up to the randomly assigned number. Game ends if you get the number exactly or if you go over. You only **win** if you get it exactly, though!

Once you finish a game, you can hit the reset button to play again. If you hit the reset button *before* the game is over however, you'll need to confirm that you're taking the loss.
